# Deploying

## QA and deploy cycles

We utilize a CI/CD deployment system built using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to ensure that new code is automatically deployed to our users as fast as possible. As part of this process, all code is first deployed to our staging environments, where it undergoes quality assurance (QA) testing before it is deployed to production. Typically, pull requests are deployed to staging immediately after they are merged.

Every time a PR is deployed to staging, it is added to a [special tracking issue](https://github.com/PetrCala/Kiroku/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AStagingDeployCash) with the label `StagingDeployCash` (there will only ever be one open at a time). This tracking issue contains information about the new application version, a list of recently deployed pull requests, and any issues found on staging that are not present on production. Every weekday at 9am PST, our QA team adds the `🔐LockCashDeploys🔐` label to that tracking issue, and that signifies that they are starting their daily QA cycle. They will perform both regular regression testing and the QA steps listed for every pull request on the `StagingDeployCash` checklist.

Once the `StagingDeployCash` is locked, we won't run any staging deploys until it is either unlocked, or we run a production deploy. If severe issues are found on staging that are not present on production, a new issue (or the PR that caused the issue) will be labeled with `DeployBlockerCash`, and added to the `StagingDeployCash` deploy checklist. If we want to resolve a deploy blocker by reverting a pull request or deploying a hotfix directly to the staging environment, we can merge a pull request with the `CP Staging` label.

Once we have confirmed to the best of our ability that there are no deploy-blocking issues and that all our new features are working as expected on staging, we'll close the `StagingDeployCash`. That will automatically trigger a production deployment, open a new `StagingDeployCash` checklist, and deploy to staging any pull requests that were merged while the previous checklist was locked.

## Key GitHub workflows

These are some of the most central [GitHub Workflows](https://github.com/PetrCala/Kiroku/tree/main/.github/workflows). There is more detailed information in the README [here](https://github.com/PetrCala/Kiroku/blob/main/.github/workflows/README.md).

### preDeploy

The [preDeploy workflow](https://github.com/PetrCala/Kiroku/blob/main/.github/workflows/preDeploy.yml) executes whenever a pull request is merged to `main`, and at a high level does the following:

- If the `StagingDeployCash` is locked, comment on the merged PR that it will be deployed later.
- Otherwise:
  - Create a new version by triggering the [`createNewVersion` workflow](https://github.com/PetrCala/Kiroku/blob/main/.github/workflows/createNewVersion.yml)
  - Update the `staging` branch from main.
- Also, if the pull request has the `CP Staging` label, it will execute the [`cherryPick` workflow](https://github.com/PetrCala/Kiroku/blob/main/.github/workflows/cherryPick.yml) to deploy the pull request directly to staging, even if the `StagingDeployCash` is locked.

### deploy

The [`deploy` workflow](https://github.com/PetrCala/Kiroku/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml) is really quite simple. It runs when code is pushed to the `staging` or `production` branches, and:

- If `staging` was updated, it creates a tag matching the new version, and pushes tags.
- If `production` was updated, it creates a GitHub Release for the new version.

### platformDeploy

The [`platformDeploy` workflow](https://github.com/PetrCala/Kiroku/blob/main/.github/workflows/platformDeploy.yml) is what actually runs the deployment on both platforms (iOS, Android). It runs a staging deploy whenever a new tag is pushed to GitHub, and runs a production deploy whenever a new release is created.

### lockDeploys

The [`lockDeploys` workflow](https://github.com/PetrCala/Kiroku/blob/main/.github/workflows/lockDeploys.yml) executes when the `StagingDeployCash` is locked, and it waits for any currently running staging deploys to finish, then gives Applause the :green_circle: to begin QA by commenting in the `StagingDeployCash` checklist.

### finishReleaseCycle

The [`finishReleaseCycle` workflow](https://github.com/PetrCala/Kiroku/blob/main/.github/workflows/finishReleaseCycle.yml) executes when the `StagingDeployCash` is closed. It updates the `production` branch from `staging` (triggering a production deploy), deploys `main` to staging (with a new `PATCH` version), and creates a new `StagingDeployCash` deploy checklist.

## Local production builds

Sometimes it might be beneficial to generate a local production version instead of testing on production. Follow the steps below for each client:

#### Local production build the iOS app

In order to compile a production iOS build, run `npm run ios-build`, this will generate a `kiroku.ipa` in the root directory of this project.

#### Local production build the Android app

To build an APK to share run (e.g. via Slack), run `npm run android-build`, this will generate a new APK in the `android/app` folder.

# On the platform choice

- We highly recommend you use Mac for working on this project. Given its compatibility with both Android and iOS, it is an ideal platform for developing a unified and efficient working environment. Fastlane, Bun, and other tools are readily available for Mac, allowing you to ease up your workflow significantly.
- If you can not, or do not want to develop on MacOS, you may need to substitute Bun with other package managers, such as `npm`, and some features of the application may be unavailable to you.

# Setting up the local environment

We use [Bun](https://bun.sh) for package managing. This experimental approach should come at the added benefit of allowing you to spend less time worrying about packages, and more time coding. Install Bun using

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

- Most of the local environment setup right after cloning the repository can be handled with the following commands.

  ```bash
  bundle update
  bun i
  bun -g i firebase-tools
  brew install cmake # For android compilation
  cd ios
  pod install
  ```

# Building for Android

- Create a `local.properties` file in the `android` folder and put the following inside:

  ```bash
  sdk.dir = /Users/USERNAME/Library/Android/sdk
  ```

  where you replace `USERNAME` with your username. On windows, adjust the path to point to your Android SDK folder.

- Make sure to add this path to the `ANDROID_HOME` by running

  ```bash
  export ANDROID_HOME = /Users/USERNAME/Library/Android/sdk
  ```

  If this variable is not set, you might be running into the **Error: Command failed with EN0ENT** bug upon trying to connect to an emulator.

- Build the `.APK` file using `bun run build:android` (calls `fastlane android build`). To bundle the build for Google Play release, run `fastlane android beta`.

- Running `bun run build:android` may fail with insufficient permissions to open the _gradlew_ file. In that case, run

  ```bash
  chmod +x ./android/gradlew
  ```

  to make the file readable.

# Fixing dependencies

To fix expo invalid dependencies, try running `npx expo install --fix`.

# Formatting

- For typescript and javascript files, we use `Prettier`
- For bash scripts, we use `shell-format`

# Platform-Specific File Extensions

In most cases, the code written for this repo should be platform-independent. In such cases, each module should have a single file, `index.js`, which defines the module's exports. There are, however, some cases in which a feature is intrinsically tied to the underlying platform. In such cases, the following file extensions can be used to export platform-specific code from a module:

- Mobile => `index.native.js`
- iOS Native App/Android Native App => `index.ios.js`/`index.android.js`
- Web => `index.website.js`
- Desktop => `index.desktop.js`

Note that `index.js` should be the default and only platform-specific implementations should be done in their respective files. i.e: If you have mobile-specific implementation in `index.native.js`, then the desktop/web implementation can be contained in a shared `index.js`.

`index.ios.js` and `index.android.js` are used when the app is running natively on respective platforms. These files are not used when users access the app through mobile browsers, but `index.website.js` is used instead. `index.native.js` are for both iOS and Android native apps. `index.native.js` should not be included in the same module as `index.ios.js` or `index.android.js`.

# Working with Firebase

- Firebase CLI is necessary for any Firebase tests/emulators to run correctly. In order to set up your local environment, run these commands first

  ```
  bun -g i firebase
  firebase login
  firebase init
  ```

## Writing Firebase rules

### Overview

- When setting the Firebase rules, here are a several useful behavior patterns to keep in mind:

  - `.read` and `.write` rules cascade in the following way:
    1. Rules get evaluated based on the node depth until the operation ultimately fails/succeeds.
    2. Allowing an operation in a higher node means that similar operations ran on any lower node will succeed.
    3. Targetting a lower node may lead to an allow as long as the final node's rule succeeds. This is despite any rules failing in higher nodes.
    4. If the node into which is written does not have any write/read rules, the rules of higher order nodes will take effect instead, based on the rules described above.
  - To demonstrate the two above-principles, consider this example:

    ```
    "higher_node": {
        ".write": true,
        "lower_node": {
            ".write: false"
        }
    }
    ```

    - Writing to the higher node: **succeeds**
    - Writing to the lower node: **succeeds**
    - **Explanation**: Attempting to write to the lower node will succeed, as a higher node is setting the `write` rule to `true`. The lower node`s rule is considered, but the higher order rule's allow operation takes precedence. Next, writing to the higher node will succeed too, regardless of the rules in the lower node (these are not considered).

  - Next, take a look at this example:

    ```
    "higher_node": {
        ".write": false,
        "lower_node": {
            ".write: true"
        }
    }
    ```

    - Writing to the higher node: **fails**
    - Writing to the lower node: **succeeds**
    - **Explanation**: When targetting the higher node, the write deny rule means the operation will fail. The rule in the lower node is not taken into consideration (regardless of the outcome). When writing to the lower node, the operation will succeed, as despite the higher node denial, it holds that denial in higher nodes

  - Under this setup, the database will allow writes into the lower order node even though you are explicitly trying to forbid it by setting the rules to `false` there. To forbid writes into the lower order node, make sure to address the higher order rules first.

- When dealing with `.validate`, the behavior is a little different. The **validation rules apply only to the node for which they are written**. In other words, they do not cascade. If you, for example, want all members of a node to be either null, or a certain string, you must set this value for all nodes for which this should be relevant. Simply setting this to a higher order node will not suffice.

### Strategy

- For read/write, define restrictive rules at higher nodes, and allow broader access at concrete nodes. For example:

  ```
  "users": {
      "$uid": {
          ".write": "auth != null && $uid ==== auth.uid",
          "friend_requests": {
              "$friend_request_id": {
                  ".write": "auth != null"
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```

  - This will allow only the user to write to their data, except for the `friend_requests` node, in which other user will be able to write data too.
  - Note that the write rules from the `$uid` node also cascade to the `friend_requests` node, protecting the latter from other users making direct modifications to it as a whole. Consequently, the only allowed write operations on this structure for other users will be to append/delete data to the `friend_requests` node.
  - If a user deletes the last of the data in that node, Firebase will automatically delete it. Thus, this operation will be recognized as a Firebase deletion, and will not fall under the defined rules. Vice versa, create it if it is the first record in that node. There is no need to write to the node reference itself.

- For a more fine-grained managemene of the type of data that can be written into a node, use `.validate`. In the previous example:

  ```
  "users": {
      "$uid": {
          ".write": "auth != null && $uid ==== auth.uid",
          "friend_requests": {
              "$friend_request_id": {
                  ".validate": "(($uid === auth.uid && newData.val() === 'sent') || ($request_id === auth.uid && newData.val() === 'received') || newData.val() === null) && $uid != $request_id",
                  ".write": "auth != null"
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```

  - This new rule ensures that the user can either add a `sent` request to their own node, add `received` request to other user's node, or delete a request. They also can not send a friend request to themselves.
  - The new, more granular logic, allows us to specify the type of data that is being written into the database.

- It might seem tricky to figure out whether to write a rule into `.validate` or `.read`/`.write`. As a rule of thumb, if the rule targets **who** is requesting the operation, `.read`/`.write` might be suitable. If specifying the type of data is what you are after, `.validate` should do the trick. More than anything, however, keep the cascading nature of each of these rule types in mind, and use it to your advantage to avoid redundancy, while keeping the rules clear and intuitive.

## Migrating the database

The database migration process is handled in a rather manual fashion. As of now, the procedure is as follows:

1. Make sure your `_dev` folder contains the folder `migrations`. This folder should in turn contain folders `input` and `output`.
2. Inside the `input` folder, place the database you want to migrate (do not rename it from the Firebase import).
3. Call the relevant migration script (located inside the `_dev/database/migration-scripts` folder) from the `_dev/main.tsx` file. You can run this file using either **bun**, or **ts-node**.
4. The output will be located in the `_dev/migrations/output` folder. From there, you can update the relevant database.

## Database maintenance

You can schedule database maintenance directly from the command line using `bun run maintenance:schedule`, provided you have the corresponding admin SDK. After the maintenance is over, you will have to cancel it through running `bun run maintenance:cancel`. For more detail, see the following sections.

### Scheduling maintenance

1. In `.env`, set the environment of the database you want to schedule the maintenance for.
2. Place the admin SDK file of this database into the project root, and make sure the admin SDK paths in the `.env` file are configured correctly to point to this file.
3. From the project root, run

   ```bash
   bun run maintenance:schedule
   ```

   From there, follow the on-screen instructions.

### Cancelling maintenance

1. Follow steps 1-2 from the previous section.
2. From the project root, run

   ```bash
   bun run maintenance:cancel
   ```

   and follow the on-screen instructions.

### Understanding the maintenance mechanism

- Scheduling a maintenance will update the `config/maintenance` node of the database. Namely, the `maintenance_mode` will be set to `true`, while the start and end time will be set to your desired values. As long as the `maintenance_mode` flag is on, all users will be shown a maintenance screen upon opening the application.
- There is no in-built check to make sure the maintenance time is over. As such, the start/end times are purely of informational character. This is to allow the developers more flexibility. Consequently, after the actual maintenance is over and the app is ready to be made available to users, simply cancel the maintenance using the instructions in the [Cancelling maintenance](#cancelling-maintenance) section. This will set the `maintenance_mode` to false, allowing application access to users.
